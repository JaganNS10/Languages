How __repr__ method works 

This method returns a string representation of the object, 
containing the values of the Name, Price, and Quantity attributes of the instance.

So when you print an instance of the using_constructor class, like print(object1), 
Python will use the __repr__ method to get the string representation, 
which will be in the format: using_constructor(name, price, quantity), 
where name, price, and quantity are the actual values of the attributes of the object.

For example, print(object1) would output something like: using_constructor(phone, 100, 2) 
based on the values you provided when creating object1.

class funtion():
    def __init__(self,name,sal):
        print("First constructor is invoked")
    @classmethod
    def display(cls):
        funtion("jagan",19)
        print("Second this will print")
funtion.display()
# funtion("jagan",19)

On the other hand, within the instantiate_from_csv method, 
when you create instances of the class using using_constructor(...), 
you're also calling the constructor to create new instances. 
The difference is that in this case, you're using the class name (using_constructor) followed by parentheses, 
which is a shorthand way to call the constructor without explicitly creating an instance variable.

So, in both cases (object = using_constructor() and within instantiate_from_csv method),
 you're calling the constructor and creating instances of the class. 
 The difference lies in how you're referencing the class: 
 directly as a class name (using_constructor) or indirectly via a variable (object).



Opening and Reading the CSV File:

with open('D:/python2/Study/Main.csv','r') as f:
:This line opens the CSV file located at 'D:/python2/Study/Main.csv' in read mode 
and assigns it to the file object f.

reader = csv.DictReader(f): This line creates a CSV reader object (DictReader) from the file object f. 
It reads the CSV file and treats each row as a dictionary 
where the keys are taken from the first row (header) of the CSV file.

items = list(reader): This line reads all the rows from the CSV file using the reader and 
converts them into a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a row of data from the CSV file.
